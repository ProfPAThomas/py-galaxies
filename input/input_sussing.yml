# mu m_H and mu_ratio are really functions of metallicity.  However, that would mean that we had to keep track
# of energy rather than temperature in the hot gas, and make the cooling rate constant vary halo by halo,
# introducing an extra calculation every time.
# In practice they are very slow functions of metallicity, so we just use a fixed value.

# Units expressed in terms that astropy understands
# The internal units are self-consistent in that, e.g., speed_unit=length_unit/time_unit.
# This is to keep the equations simple and avoid missing conversion factors.
# Also, although units are specified, within the code, quantities are stored as values only, for efficiency:
# I am unsure as to whether using units within numpy will slow things down, so possibly this could be relaxed.
