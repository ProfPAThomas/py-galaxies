Desired/required halo properties:

Essential:
* Mass (not critical which one)
* Position (ditto), but mean is obvious choice
* Velocity (ditto), but mean is obvious choice
* Mean square radius (np.sqrt(np.sum(radius**2))
* Velocity dispersion (3-D), i.e. mean square relative velocity
* Vmax - maximum of the rotation curve

Highly desirable:
* Some sort of substructure regularity/smoothness parameter
* Ditto in velocity space
* Rhalf - half mass radius
* Ditto in velocity space (why not?)
* Angular momentum, or specific angular momentum, about CofM

Desirable:
