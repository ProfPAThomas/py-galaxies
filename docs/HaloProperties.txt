Desired/required halo properties:

Essential:
* Mass (not critical which one)
* Position (ditto), but mean is obvious choice
* Velocity (ditto), but mean is obvious choice
* Velocity dispersion
* Vmax - maximum of the rotation curve

Desirable:
* Some sort of substructure regularity/smoothness parameter
* Ditto in velocity space
* Rhalf - half mass radius
* Angular momentum, or specific angular momentum, about CofM
